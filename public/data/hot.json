Morata became the second Spanish player to score in his first three World Cup appearances since Telmo Zarra in 1950. Japan turned their fortune around in the second half when Ritsu Doan and Ao Tanaka scored within three minutes of each other. Spain had its chances late but none went through and Japan held on to win 2-1 and advances to the knockout stage in consecutive World Cups.\n\n#FOXSoccer #FIFAWorldCup #Japan #Spain\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

Morata became the second Spanish player to score in his first three World Cup appearances since Telmo Zarra in 1950. Japan turned their fortune around in the second half when Ritsu Doan and Ao Tanaka scored within three minutes of each other. Spain had its chances late but none went through and Japan held on to win 2-1 and advances to the knockout stage in consecutive World Cups.\n\n#FOXSoccer #FIFAWorldCup #Japan #Spain\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER\nThe all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb\n\n►FOX Sports YouTube Channel: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSPORTS\n►PBC ON FOX’s YouTube Channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribePBCONFOX\n►WWE ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeWWEONFOX\n►NASCAR ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeNASCARonFOX\n►CFB ON FOX YouTube channel: https://foxs.pt/SubscribeCFBonFOX\n\nSee more from FOX Soccer: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccer\nLike FOX Soccer on Facebook: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerFacebook\nFollow FOX Soccer on Twitter: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerTwitter\nFollow FOX Soccer on Instagram: https://foxs.pt/FOXSoccerInstagram\n\nAbout FOX Soccer:\nWith exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

Given that BTS’s RM (aka Kim Nam-joon) is based in South Korea, we let it slide — not least because his team put together one of the most impressive Tiny Desk facsimiles we’ve seen yet. What really sets it apart is the huge array of shelf-bound ephemera, which is bound to have the BTS Army sleuthing in the YouTube comments. What’s a random tchotchke and what’s an Easter egg? Study the set closely!\n\nRM timed his solo Tiny Desk debut — which follows BTS’s home concert from back in 2020 — to coincide with the release of his first official studio album, Indigo. But he kicks off the set with an older track, “seoul,” which first appeared on his 2018 mixtape mono. From there, he showcases the first two tracks from Indigo: the rap-driven “Yun” and the funky “Still Life,” both of which are inspired by RM’s love of and fascination with painting. The studio tracks feature Erykah Badu and Anderson .Paak, respectively, both of whom get shoutouts in this set. But here, the focus never drifts away from the star at center stage — no matter how closely you might squint at the stuffed animals, housewares, clocks and toys (not to mention Big Mouth Billy Bass!) behind him.\n\nNow, if we can just get him to visit the real Tiny Desk…\n\n\nSET LIST\n“seoul”\n“Yun”\n“Still Life”\n\nMUSICIANS\nRM: vocals\nDOCSKIM: keyboard \njohn eun: guitar\nJaeshin Park: bass\nJK Kim: drums\n\nCREDITS\nDirector: Oui Kim (OUI)\nProducer: Yeonjin Kim (OUI)\nAUDIO:\nJEONG WOO YEONG\nSon Yu Jeong\n\nCREW:\nHuiwon Song\nSunyoung Kim\nHyeri Shin \nEumKo\nYoungwoo Lee\nEunil Lee\nSungju Min \nKihun Kim \nSeungjong Lee\nYuntae Ko \nKidung Kim\nKiyong Eom\nDonghyun Lee\nDoosoo Choi\nYujin Jung\nSangjoon Lee \nKieun Lee \nKihyun Lee \nSeonghyeon Heo\nInsol Yun\nHyeongeun Kim \nYujin Ko \nDaeun Han\nJae Yoo \nGANi \nLeehyun Kim \nYeonhwa Cha\nDaye Shin\nDaniella Kim\nSaeyong Oh\nLee Jung Min\nLee Hyeon Ki\nJeong Dae Seong\nJinho Jeong\nRachel Um\nJennie Lee\nRosa Kim\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nVideo Producer: Kara Frame\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Suraya Mohamed, Bobby Carter, Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Hazel Cills, Marissa Lorusso, Ashley Pointer, Jill Britton, Sofia Seidel\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n#tinydesk #rm #bts #nprmusic",
